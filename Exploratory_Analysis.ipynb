    "# Exploratory Analysis of Bike Data\n",
    "In this project I will explore bike data from Ford GoBikes. I will focus on operational questions such as, how long are customers riding bikes, which stations are frequented the most, and if we can re-allocate bikes during the day where should we move bikes to? I'll try to learn as much as possible about how people use bikes using mainly plots"
