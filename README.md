# Visualizing Bike Share Data in San Francisco

## Overview
The focus of this project is to develop my visualization skills. I will use exploratory and explanatory plots to get an understanding of the bike data from Ford GoBikes. I will explore how riders use bike share across San Francisco. Do riders use the bikes for their commute? When are riders riding the most? How does bike usage fair across the year? How do pricing models impact usage?

I got the data set from the Ford GoBike website. I will not include the data set in this repository due to the size. If you'd like to use the data yourself, go to this link to download the data.

### Data Files
I used the following data sets for this project. Its essentially just the whole year of 2018 but the website offers them one month at a time:
- 201801-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201802-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201803-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201804-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201805-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201806-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201807-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201808-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201809-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201810-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201811-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201812-fordgobike-tripdata.csv

This repository has three main files.
### Exploratory Analysis
'Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb' - this file contains all the code and plots for exploring the bike data. Also, lots of notes to document my thought process as I learned more about the data set.

### Explanatory Analysis
'Explanatory_Analysis.ipynb' - this file has a summary of my findings and polished plots to tell a story about how riders use bike share in San Francisco. I summarize my findings in commute use, pricing models, and bike usage across the day and year.

### Slide Deck for Explanatory Analysis
'Explanatory_Visualizations.slides.html' - this file can be opened via web browser to view slides and my findings in a polished presentation format.
