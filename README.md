The focus of this project is to develop my visualization skills. I will use exploratory and explanatory plots to get an understanding of the bike data from Ford GoBikes. I will focus on operational questions such as, how long are customers riding bikes, which stations are frequented the most, and if we can re-allocate bikes during the day where should we move bikes to?

I got the data set from the Ford GoBike website. I will not include the data set in this repository due to the size. If you'd like to use the data yourself, go to this link to download the data.

I used the following data sets for this project. The first one is an entire year's worth of data and the second one is a month of recent bike data:
- 2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv
- 201904-fordgobike-tripdata.csv.zip
